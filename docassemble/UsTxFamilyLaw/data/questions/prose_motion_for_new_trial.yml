question: |
  Do you want to use the short form?
subquestion: |
  There is a long form and a short form of this motion. The short form is more appropriate when you are filing this motion for no other reason than to extend the court's power over the case.
  
  The long form should be used if you are contemplating an appeal.
  
  Both forms are legally effective.
